# ACM Intent

## Problem

Agentic development lacks a consistent management layer. Each project starts from scratch — no shared process, no reusable capabilities catalog, no memory of what worked before. Agents have no framework for how to discover requirements, design solutions, build deliverables, or maintain the environment they operate in.

## Outcome

A lightweight, spec-driven framework that defines how agentic projects are structured, managed, and maintained — applicable to any project type (software, artifacts, workflows). The framework provides:

- **Stages** that guide work from idea to deliverable (Discover → Design → Develop → Deliver)
- **An environment layer** that persists across projects (capabilities, knowledge, memory, maintenance, validation)
- **Specs as contracts** that define "good" before building
- **Progressive disclosure** so agents load only the context they need

## Why It Matters

The system should get better over time. Each project completed should make the next one easier — through captured knowledge, curated capabilities, and refined processes. Without a management layer, every project is isolated and learnings are lost.
