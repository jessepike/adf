# ACM Design Stage Specification

## Purpose

Define the Design stage — the second stage in the ACM workflow where a validated Brief becomes technical specifications ready for development.

---

## Stage Overview

> **"How will we build this?"**

Design transforms a validated Brief into actionable technical decisions. The agent works with the human to clarify ambiguities, explore approaches, make decisions, and document them in a design specification.

**Primary Deliverable:**
- `design.md` — Technical specification covering architecture, interface, data, and capabilities

**Supporting Deliverables (when complexity requires):**
- `architecture.md` — System architecture (Apps, complex Workflows)
- `data-model.md` — Data structures and persistence
- `interface-spec.md` — UI/UX or format specification
- Individual ADRs for significant decisions

---

## Phase Model

| Phase | Description | Human Involvement | Agent Involvement |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Intake & Clarification** | Understand Brief, resolve ambiguities, surface decisions | High (answering questions, making choices) | High (structured questioning, probing) |
| **Technical Design** | Produce design artifacts based on decisions | Low-Medium (review, feedback) | High (drafting, iterating) |
| **Review Loop** | Validate decisions through internal and external review | Medium (orchestrating external, deciding on feedback) | High (Ralph Loop, integrating feedback) |
| **Finalization** | Exit criteria check, handoff prep | Medium (sign-off) | High (validation checks) |

---

## Inputs

What enters the Design stage:

| Input | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `intent.md` | Discover | North Star — loaded for alignment |
| `discover-brief.md` | Discover | Detailed contract — primary input, fully consumed |
| Project classification | Brief | Type + modifiers determine required outputs |
| ACM specs | Environment layer | Design spec, Project Types spec |
| Current state | `status.md` | Where we left off (if resuming) |

---

## Outputs

What Design produces:

| Output | Description | Location |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `design.md` | Primary technical specification | `/docs/design.md` |
| Supporting specs | Architecture, data model, interface (if >500 lines) | `/docs/design-*.md` |
| Updated decision log | Key decisions with rationale | Section in design.md or `/docs/decisions.md` |
| Updated backlog | Implementation ideas, deferred features | Section in design.md or `/docs/backlog.md` |

All artifacts must pass exit criteria before handoff to Develop.

---

## Breakout Threshold

**500 lines** — the threshold for splitting artifacts.

**Under 500 lines:** Keep everything in `design.md` with sections for architecture, interface, data, capabilities.

**Over 500 lines:** Create parent `design.md` (~100-200 lines) with:
- Overview and purpose
- Links to sub-documents
- Decision log summary

Child documents each stay under 500 lines:
- `design-architecture.md`
- `design-interface.md`
- `design-data-model.md`
- `design-capabilities.md`

**Rationale:** 500 lines (~3,000-3,500 tokens) sits in the reliable zone for LLM processing, avoids "lost in the middle" degradation, and remains human-reviewable in one sitting.

---

## Phase Details

### 1. Intake & Clarification

**Purpose:** Ensure agent fully understands Brief and human has made all necessary decisions before design work begins.

**Activities:**
- Read and internalize Brief + Intent
- Identify ambiguities, gaps, implicit assumptions
- Surface decisions that need human input
- Clarify technical preferences and constraints
- Identify recommended capabilities (tools, skills, sub-agents)

**Agent role:** Active interviewer. Use structured questioning (AskUserQuestion pattern) to probe deeply. Challenge assumptions. Surface non-obvious considerations. Recommend approaches where appropriate.

**Human role:** Answer questions, make decisions, provide domain context. This phase is highly interactive.

**Questioning scope:**
- Brief interpretation ("I read X as meaning Y — correct?")
- Ambiguity resolution ("Brief says 'simple auth' — what does that mean specifically?")
- Technical preferences ("Any strong opinions on stack, or should I recommend?")
- Constraint clarification ("You listed 'low cost' — is there a specific ceiling?")
- Proactive recommendations ("Based on Brief, I'd suggest X approach — thoughts?")
- Risk surfacing ("I see potential issue with Y — how do you want to handle?")
- Prioritization ("If we hit constraints, what's negotiable vs non-negotiable?")
- Capabilities ("Based on this, you'll need X, Y, Z tools — anything else you want available?")

**What NOT to ask:**
- Timeline estimates ("this will take X weeks")
- Resource/effort planning (that's Develop's concern)
- Scope expansion suggestions (YAGNI — stick to Brief)

**Exit signal:** Agent has enough clarity to draft design.md. Human confirms: "You have what you need."

---

### 2. Technical Design

**Purpose:** Produce design artifacts that capture all technical decisions needed for development.

**Activities:**
- Draft `design.md` with all required sections
- Document architecture decisions (for Apps/Workflows)
- Specify interface and format requirements
- Define data model (if applicable)
- Inventory required capabilities
- Capture decisions in decision log
- Note deferred items in backlog

**Agent role:** Heavy lifting. Translate clarified requirements into technical specifications. Propose concrete approaches. Identify gaps during drafting.

**Human role:** Review drafts, provide feedback, approve direction.

**Exit signal:** Draft design.md exists with all required sections populated. Ready for review.

---

### 3. Review Loop

**Purpose:** Validate design decisions through structured review — first internally, then with external models.

**Two-Phase Review Model:**

| Phase | Reviewer | Mechanism | Value |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Internal** | Primary agent (Claude) | Ralph Loop | Fast iteration, catches inconsistencies, validates against Brief |
| **Phase 2: External** | Other models (GPT, Gemini) | Manual submission | Diverse perspectives, catches blind spots, validates technical choices |

---

#### Phase 1: Internal Review (Ralph Loop)

**Purpose:** Thorough self-review. Get design.md as strong as possible before external review.

**Mechanism:** Ralph Loop with Claude — iterates until no P1 issues remain.

**Review scope:**

- **Brief alignment** — Does design deliver what Brief specifies?
- **Completeness** — All required sections for project type?
- **Feasibility** — Can this actually be built with stated constraints?
- **Consistency** — Internal contradictions? Conflicting decisions?
- **Capability coverage** — Are identified tools/skills sufficient?
- **Interface clarity** — Would a developer know what to build?
- **Data model soundness** — Structures support the requirements?
- **Decision quality** — Rationale documented? Options considered?
- **Downstream usability** — Can Develop start from this?

**Exit signal:** No P1 issues remain. Design is as strong as self-review can make it.

**Typical iterations:** 2-4

---

#### Phase 2: External Review (Multiple Models)

**Purpose:** Get perspectives the internal reviewer missed. Different models catch different things.

**Mechanism:** Submit design.md + Brief + Intent to external models. Manual orchestration.

**Review scope:**

- What internal reviewer might have missed
- Technical soundness of architecture decisions
- Technology/stack appropriateness
- Scalability and maintainability concerns
- Security considerations
- Alternative approaches worth considering
- Blind spots in interface/UX design

**Process:**
1. Submit design.md + Brief + Intent to 2+ external models
2. Collect feedback, extract discrete issues
3. Log issues with source attribution
4. Prioritize: High-impact issues from multiple reviewers = P1
5. Address P1s, assess P2s
6. Re-submit if major issues found

**Exit signal:** External reviewers find no new P1 issues. Cross-reviewer consensus on core decisions.

**Typical cycles:** 1-2

---

#### Review Focus by Project Type

| Type | Primary Review Focus |
|------|---------------------|
| **Artifact** | Format appropriateness, audience fit, capability coverage, clarity |
| **App** | Architecture soundness, tech stack fit, interface usability, data model, scalability |
| **Workflow** | Integration points, orchestration logic, error handling, data flow, trigger reliability |

---

### 4. Finalization

**Purpose:** Verify exit criteria. Prepare for Develop handoff.

**Activities:**
- Run exit criteria checklist
- Ensure all P1 issues resolved
- Verify capabilities inventory is complete (Develop can add more if needed)
- Confirm decision log captures key choices
- Update backlog with any deferred items
- Update status.md to stage: complete
- Human sign-off

**Agent role:** Run validation checks. Flag any gaps. Prepare handoff summary.

**Human role:** Final review and approval.

**Exit signal:** All exit criteria met. Human confirms ready for Develop.

---

## Type-Specific Outputs

Design outputs vary by project type. Use this as guidance, not rigid requirement.

### All Types (Required)

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Summary** | What this design accomplishes, reference to Brief |
| **Capabilities** | Tools, skills, sub-agents, integrations needed |
| **Interface & Format** | How users/consumers interact with the output |
| **Decision Log** | Key decisions with rationale |
| **Backlog** | Deferred items for future consideration |
| **Open Questions** | Anything unresolved (should be minimal) |
| **Issue Log** | Issues found during review with severity, complexity, and resolution |
| **Develop Handoff** | Stage transition document — summary, decisions, capabilities, open questions, success criteria, implementation guidance |
| **Review Log** | Chronological record of review phases, findings, and actions taken |
| **Revision History** | Version history with dates and changes |

### App (Additional)

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Architecture** | System structure, components, relationships |
| **Tech Stack** | Languages, frameworks, services, infrastructure |
| **Data Model** | Entities, relationships, persistence approach |
| **Security** | Auth, authorization, data protection approach |

### Workflow (Additional)

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Orchestration** | How steps coordinate, sequencing, parallelism |
| **Integration Points** | External systems, APIs, data sources |
| **Data Flow** | Inputs, transformations, outputs |
| **Error Handling** | Failure modes, retry logic, alerting |
| **Triggers** | What initiates the workflow, scheduling |

### Artifact (Additional)

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Format Specification** | File type, structure, styling requirements |
| **Content Outline** | Sections, flow, key elements |
| **Source Materials** | Inputs, references, data to incorporate |

---

## Develop Handoff Section

**Purpose:** Create a stage transition document that gives Develop everything needed to start implementation without re-reading the entire design.

**Location:** Between Issue Log and Review Log sections in design.md.

**Required subsections:**

### Design Summary
- 2-3 sentence overview of what was designed
- Project type, scope, architecture approach

### Key Design Decisions
- Table format: Decision | Rationale | Implication for Develop
- Include decisions from Decision Log that directly affect implementation
- Focus on "what Develop needs to know" not exhaustive history

### Capabilities Needed
- Runtime, libraries, tools, integrations
- Configuration requirements (.env, config files)
- Any external service dependencies

### Open Questions for Develop
- List all Open Questions marked "Implement during Develop" or "Address during Develop"
- Number them for easy tracking
- Include context for why they're deferred (not just "figure it out")

### Success Criteria (Verify During Implementation)
- Copy relevant success criteria from Brief
- Make them checkboxes so Develop can track
- These are the acceptance tests

### What Was Validated
- Summarize review outcomes
- Note what core design elements were validated
- Give Develop confidence about what's solid

### Implementation Guidance
- Recommended build order
- Edge cases to test
- Integration test strategy
- Project structure reference

### Reference Documents
- Point to Intent, Brief, Design
- Specify read order

**Why this matters:**
- Develop stage often starts in a new session or by a different person
- Handoff prevents context loss at stage transitions
- Makes design decisions actionable
- Reduces time to productive implementation

3. Commit with `chore(design): stage complete — {summary}`
4. Run `/clear`

---

## Context Loading

### What the Primary Agent Needs

The agent working through Design needs context on:

1. **ACM Framework** — What is ACM, what stage are we in
2. **Stage Workflow** — This spec (phases, activities, exit criteria)
3. **Project Artifacts** — Intent (always), Brief (consumed), existing project state
4. **Project Types** — Classification system (determines required outputs)
5. **Current State** — Where we left off (from status.md)

### Context Map (for CLAUDE.md)

```markdown
## Context Map

| File | Load When | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| intent.md | Always | North Star |
| discover-brief.md | Design stage | Primary input — fully consumed |
| design.md | Design stage (after created) | Working design spec |
| ADF-DESIGN-SPEC.md | Design stage (reference) | Stage workflow |
| ADF-PROJECT-TYPES-SPEC.md | Design stage (reference) | Output requirements by type |
```

Specs are reference documents — load on demand, not into every context.

---

## Capabilities in Design vs Develop

**Design identifies** recommended capabilities based on architecture decisions:
- "Based on this design, you'll need: Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL, Redis for caching, OpenAI API access, the Excel skill for report generation"

**Develop can modify** during implementation:
- Add capabilities discovered during build
- Remove capabilities that aren't needed
- Substitute alternatives that achieve the same goal

Design's capabilities list is a starting point, not a constraint.

---

## Supporting Artifacts

### Prompts

Three prompts support the Design stage:

| Prompt | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Design Intake Prompt | `/prompts/design-intake-prompt.md` | Structured clarification interview |
| Design Ralph Review Prompt | `/prompts/design-ralph-review-prompt.md` | Phase 1 internal iteration |
| Design External Review Prompt | `/prompts/design-external-review-prompt.md` | Phase 2 external review |

## Session Continuity

Design may span multiple sessions. To maintain continuity:

1. **status.md** tracks current phase, last action, next steps
2. **Issue Log** in design.md tracks feedback and resolution status
3. **Decision Log** in design.md tracks choices made

New session workflow:
1. Agent reads CLAUDE.md (loads context map)
2. Agent reads status.md (gets current state)
3. Agent reads design.md (if exists) or Brief (if starting)
4. Agent picks up where previous session left off
5. At session end, agent updates status.md

---

## Planning Artifacts Convention

When Design produces working artifacts beyond design.md (e.g., architecture explorations, decision analysis), place them in `docs/acm/` per ADF-FOLDER-STRUCTURE-SPEC.md. These are stage-scoped and archived at stage completion.
