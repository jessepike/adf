| B45 | Stage transition cleanup process — when a sub-project completes a stage or the docs/ workspace shifts to a new sub-project, archive previous stage artifacts to `_archive/{project-name}/`. Define convention in ADF-STAGES-SPEC or ADF-FOLDER-STRUCTURE-SPEC. | Enhancement | ACM | P2 | S | — | Pending |

| B69 | execute-plan plugin still installed — removal was incomplete (deleted source, didn't uninstall plugin) | Bug | adf-plugins | P1 | XS | — | Pending |
| B70 | Frontmatter spec doesn't distinguish ephemeral artifacts — audit over-applies to docs/adf/ working docs | Spec gap | specs | P2 | S | — | Pending |
| B71 | User CLAUDE.md has stale "acm-env" reference — incomplete ACM→ADF rename | Bug | environment | P1 | XS | — | Pending |

## Archive

| ID | Item | Completed | Notes |
|----|------|-----------|-------|
| B64 | Rename acm-env plugin to adf-env | 2026-02-02 | Updated plugin.json, marketplace.json, known_marketplaces.json, installed_plugins.json. Updated directory references, command prefixes (/acm-env:* → /adf-env:*), baseline.yaml. Bumped to v2.0.0. Part of ACM→ADF rename (commit 0b3276f). |
| B65 | Rename acm-review plugin to adf-review | 2026-02-02 | Updated plugin.json, marketplace.json, .claude/rules/review-process.md references. Command prefixes (/acm-review:* → /adf-review:*). Bumped to v2.0.0. Part of ACM→ADF rename (commit 0b3276f). |
| B66 | Update consumer projects after plugin renames | 2026-02-02 | No active consumers identified requiring updates. Plugin system fully functional with adf-plugins marketplace and adf-env/adf-review plugins. |
| B60 | Create start-discover-prompt.md | 2026-02-02 | Created entry-point prompt for Discover stage v1.0.0. Parallel to start-design/develop/deliver prompts. Covers project setup validation, state update, context loading, and exploration phase initiation. |
| B61 | Reorder Develop HARD GATE | 2026-02-02 | Fixed HARD GATE placement in ADF-DEVELOP-SPEC.md v2.1.0. Moved from after Phase 3 to after Phase 4 (Review Loop). Phase 4 now "Review Loop & Approval" combining internal/external review + human approval. Correct pattern: Plan → Review → HARD GATE → Execution (matches Deliver spec). Updated start-develop-prompt.md to v2.2.0. |
| B39 | Add deliver enum support to ADF MCP server | 2026-02-02 | Added "deliver" to get_stage, get_review_prompt, get_transition_prompt enums. Updated STAGE_FILES, PROMPT_MAP, TRANSITION_FILES mappings. Added develop_to_deliver transition validation. Rebuilt MCP server, 58/59 tests passing. |
| B51 | Update ADF MCP server get_stage enum to include deliver | 2026-02-02 | Completed with B39 — same changeset. get_stage now accepts "deliver" and serves ADF-DELIVER-SPEC.md. |
| B15 | Deliver stage spec | 2026-02-02 | ADF-DELIVER-SPEC.md v1.0.0 — 8 phases with Review → HARD GATE → Execution pattern (corrected from Develop), 3-tier testing model (automated, browser, manual), project-type specific guidance, deployment focus. Created 3 prompts: start-deliver-prompt.md, deliver-ralph-review-prompt.md, deliver-external-review-prompt.md. Also added B61 (fix Develop HARD GATE placement). Unblocks B39 + B51 (ACM MCP server deliver enum support). |

| B56 | Universal exit criteria + stage boundary handoff in DESIGN-SPEC | 2026-02-01 | v1.1.0 — structured exit criteria (universal + design-specific + type-specific), handoff protocol, docs/adf/ convention, updated references. |
