|----|------|------|-----------|-----|------|-------|--------|
| B62 | Execute-plan orchestration skill — implementation (7 phases: Core Orchestrator → Ralph Loop Integration → Phase Validator → Parallelization → TDD → Traceability → CLI).

## Archive

| ID | Item | Completed | Notes |
|----|------|-----------|-------|
| B60 | Create start-discover-prompt.md | 2026-02-02 | Created entry-point prompt for Discover stage v1.0.0. Parallel to start-design/develop/deliver prompts. Covers project setup validation, state update, context loading, and exploration phase initiation. |
| B61 | Reorder Develop HARD GATE | 2026-02-02 | Fixed HARD GATE placement in ACM-DEVELOP-SPEC.md v2.1.0. Moved from after Phase 3 to after Phase 4 (Review Loop). Phase 4 now "Review Loop & Approval" combining internal/external review + human approval. Correct pattern: Plan → Review → HARD GATE → Execution (matches Deliver spec). Updated start-develop-prompt.md to v2.2.0. |
| B39 | Add deliver enum support to ACM MCP server | 2026-02-02 | Added "deliver" to get_stage, get_review_prompt, get_transition_prompt enums. Updated STAGE_FILES, PROMPT_MAP, TRANSITION_FILES mappings. Added develop_to_deliver transition validation. Rebuilt MCP server, 58/59 tests passing. |
| B51 | Update ACM MCP server get_stage enum to include deliver | 2026-02-02 | Completed with B39 — same changeset. get_stage now accepts "deliver" and serves ACM-DELIVER-SPEC.md. |
| B15 | Deliver stage spec | 2026-02-02 | ACM-DELIVER-SPEC.md v1.0.0 — 8 phases with Review → HARD GATE → Execution pattern (corrected from Develop), 3-tier testing model (automated, browser, manual), project-type specific guidance, deployment focus. Created 3 prompts: start-deliver-prompt.md, deliver-ralph-review-prompt.md, deliver-external-review-prompt.md. Also added B61 (fix Develop HARD GATE placement). Unblocks B39 + B51 (ACM MCP server deliver enum support). |
| B55 | Universal exit criteria + stage boundary handoff in DISCOVER-SPEC | 2026-02-01 | v1.3.0 — structured exit criteria (universal + discover-specific), handoff protocol, docs/acm/ convention, updated references. |
| B56 | Universal exit criteria + stage boundary handoff in DESIGN-SPEC | 2026-02-01 | v1.1.0 — structured exit criteria (universal + design-specific + type-specific), handoff protocol, docs/acm/ convention, updated references. |
| B57 | docs/acm/ convention in DISCOVER-SPEC and DESIGN-SPEC | 2026-02-01 | Planning Artifacts Convention section added to both specs. |
| B46 | Update start-develop-prompt.md for Phase 7-8 + testing | 2026-02-01 | v2.1.0 — added Phase 7 (Documentation) + Phase 8 (Closeout), two-tier testing model, build-to-design verification, docs/acm/ paths, commit cadence. |
| B47 | Update develop-ralph-review-prompt.md for testing strategy | 2026-02-01 | v3.1.0 — expanded Testing Strategy to two-tier model + project-type checks, added Build-to-Design Verification dimension, fixed artifact paths to docs/acm/. |
