# ACM Backlog

## Queue

| ID | Item | Type | Component | Pri | Size | Status |
|----|------|------|-----------|-----|------|--------|
| B42 | Structured session handoff spec — define a parseable handoff format that agents produce at phase boundaries so next session can auto-orient (read order, what's done, build notes, remaining work) | Enhancement | ACM | P1 | M | Pending |
| B43 | Automated phase transitions — agent completes phase → commit → produce handoff → `/clear` → next session auto-resumes from handoff without human prompting. Extends Phase Boundary Protocol in ACM-DEVELOP-SPEC.md | Enhancement | ACM | P1 | L | Pending |
| B35 | Agents not consulting capabilities-registry before installing capabilities — review process and diagnose why | Bug | acm-env | P1 | M | Pending |
| B34 | Evaluate MCP tools for environment — memory-mcp, filesystem-mcp, sequentialthinking-mcp, everything-mcp | Enhancement | acm-env | P1 | M | Pending |
| B15 | Deliver stage spec | New spec | ACM | P2 | M | Pending |
| B18 | Design memory layer spec (MEMORY-SPEC.md) | New spec | memory | P2 | L | Pending |
| B19 | Scaffold memory repo at `~/code/_shared/memory/` | Setup | memory | P2 | S | Pending |
| B36 | ACM MCP server — maintenance primitive not addressed in tool surface | Enhancement | acm-server | P3 | S | Pending |
| B37 | Align "meta layer" → "environment layer" terminology across all specs and prompts | Terminology | ACM | P2 | M | Pending |
| B38 | Connect self-improvement loop to MCP server brief — document which steps are covered vs deferred to memory/KB | Docs | ACM | P3 | S | Pending |
| B39 | Add `deliver` enum support to ACM MCP server once ACM-DELIVER-SPEC.md is created | Enhancement | acm-server | P2 | S | Blocked by B15 |
| B40 | Update ACM-STAGES-SPEC.md environment layer references to include ACM MCP server alongside acm-env | Docs | ACM | P2 | S | Done |
| B41 | Move ACM-*-SPEC.md + ACM-TAXONOMY.md into docs/specs/ — update all 40+ file references | Refactor | ACM | P2 | M | Pending |
| B14 | Automated multi-model review orchestration | Architecture | ACM | P3 | L | Pending |
| B20 | Evaluate extracting Knowledge (kb/) from ACM into own repo | Architecture | ACM/kb | P3 | M | Pending |
| B21 | Automated self-improvement loop (capture → distill → apply) | Architecture | memory + kb | P3 | L | Pending |
| B22 | Community knowledge ingestion pipeline | Architecture | kb | P3 | L | Pending |
