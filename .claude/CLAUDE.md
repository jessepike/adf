# ACM Project Context

## What This Is

ACM (Agentic Development Framework) is the framework that defines how agentic projects are structured, managed, and maintained. It owns orchestration, knowledge, and the specs that govern all stages.

## Current Stage

**Develop** — building out the ACM framework itself and its environment layer.

## Orientation

1. `.claude/rules/` — Hard constraints (read first, always enforced)
2. `status.md` — Current state, session log, next steps
3. `BACKLOG.md` — All tracked work items

## Stage Flow

Stages: Discover → Design → Develop → Deliver

Each stage follows: **Work → Review → Update → Validate → Close out → Transition**

- Query `get_stage()` from ACM MCP for phase details at each stage
- Review is an orchestration-layer service — invoke the review skill when needed
- At phase boundaries: update handoff block in tasks.md, commit, `/clear`
- At stage boundaries: verify exit criteria via `check_project_health()`, update status.md

- Progressive disclosure — summary first, details on demand via MCP
