# Execute-Plan Design - APPROVED ✅

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Review Cycles:** 2 (complete)
**Status:** APPROVED - Ready for Implementation

---

## Review Summary

### Cycle 1
- **Issues Found:** 3 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low
- **High Issues:** Task grouping algorithm, stuck detection, ralph parsing
- **Action:** Fixed all 3 High issues

### Cycle 2
- **Issues Found:** 0 Critical, 0 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low
- **Validation:** All Cycle 1 fixes verified correct
- **New Issues:** Minor optimization opportunities (non-blocking)
- **Action:** APPROVED for implementation

---

## Final Assessment

**Design Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent
- Research-backed patterns (LangGraph, Temporal, Airflow, Bazel)
- Well-structured architecture
- Appropriately scoped for MVP
- YAGNI compliant

**Issue Status:**
- ✅ Critical: 0
- ✅ High: 0 (all resolved)
- ⚠️ Medium: 2 (non-blocking, can address during implementation)
- ⚠️ Low: 1 (minor validation enhancement)

---

## Remaining Medium/Low Issues

**Medium (handle during implementation):**
1. Circular dependency detection optimization (O(N²) → O(N) space)
2. File conflict detection for parallel groups (add if conflicts observed)

**Low (optional):**
1. Task ID format validation in `extract_task_number()`

**All non-blocking - implementation can proceed.**

## What Was Accomplished

### Research Phase
- Studied orchestration patterns from production systems
- Analyzed LangGraph, Airflow, Bazel, GitHub Actions, Temporal
- Identified proven patterns for DAG resolution, parallelization, checkpointing

### Design Phase
- Created comprehensive design (970 lines)
- Defined 3 core components (orchestrator, task-executor, phase-validator)
- Specified dependency resolution, task grouping, error handling
- Documented integration points, risk mitigation, success criteria

### Review Phase (2 Cycles)
- **Cycle 1:** Identified 3 High issues via Ralph Loop internal review
- **Fixes:** Added ~280 lines of implementation logic to resolve High issues
- **Cycle 2:** Validated fixes, confirmed 0 Critical/High issues remain

## Ready for Build Phase ✅

**Approved to proceed with:**
1. Phase 1: Core Orchestrator (Week 1)
   - Parse plan.md + tasks.md
   - Create TaskList
   - Sequential task execution
   - Atomic commits per task
   - Basic error handling

2. Phase 2: Ralph Loop Integration (Week 2)
   - Phase boundary reviews
   - Issue parsing with robust error detection
   - Fix task creation workflow

3. Phases 3-7: (Weeks 3-7)
   - Phase validator
   - Parallelization (3-5 groups)
   - TDD enforcement
   - Traceability
   - CLI polish

---

## ACM Workflow Compliance ✅

**Followed proper process:**
- ✅ Mandatory internal review (Ralph Loop)
- ✅ 2 review cycles (found issues → fixed → validated)
- ✅ Design approved only after 0 Critical, 0 High
- ✅ Medium/Low issues documented for implementation phase
- ✅ Ready for proper phase transition

**Next ACM steps:**
1. Update status.md with session log
2. Commit design document to ACM repo
3. Transition to Develop Build phase
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

---

## Success Metrics

**Design Phase Success:**
- ✅ Comprehensive architecture (based on proven patterns)
- ✅ All High issues resolved
- ✅ Implementation roadmap defined
- ✅ Test strategy specified
- ✅ Integration points documented

**Implementation Phase Success Criteria:**
- Execute Phase 1 of link-triage-pipeline (13 tasks)
- Produce 13+ atomic commits
- Ralph-loop quality gate works
- Phase validator checks exit criteria
- Traceability system functions

---

## 🎉 Design Complete - Ready to Build!

**Recommendation:** Proceed to implementation Phase 1 (Core Orchestrator).

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 2 weeks (Phases 1-2)
**Estimated Time to Full Feature:** 7 weeks (all phases)
