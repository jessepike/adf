## Session Log

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 2026-01-27 | Discover stage complete. Two-phase review validated. YAGNI integrated. Ready for Design stage spec. |
| 2026-01-28 | Design and Develop stage specs complete. Supporting specs updated. |
| 2026-01-29 | Brainstormed and implemented acm-env plugin. Created ACM-ENV-PLUGIN-SPEC.md. Built full plugin scaffold with 4 commands, SessionStart hook, env-auditor skill, baseline.yaml, and dependency checker. Updated ACM-TAXONOMY.md (environment terms + 8 design decisions), ACM-CONTEXT-ARTIFACT-SPEC.md (replaced deferred acm-validate/acm-prune with acm-env reference), ACM-STAGES-SPEC.md (added acm-env as meta layer manager). |
| 2026-01-29 | Develop stage debrief session. Defined environment layer architecture (six primitives: orchestration, capabilities, knowledge, memory, maintenance, validation). Created ACM-ENVIRONMENT-SPEC.md, BACKLOG.md. Completed B1 (hardened start-develop prompt v2.0.0), B3 (phase boundary protocol in develop spec v1.2.0), B4 (review scoring across all 6 prompts — Critical/High/Low, min 2 max 10 cycles). Created capabilities-registry extraction brief for separate agent. Researched Claude Code 2.1.3 (commands folded into skills). Analyzed agent-harness sync system. Key decisions: registry as peer repo, memory as own repo, knowledge stays in ACM, workers are skills not separate repo, vendor is metadata not folder structure. |
| 2026-01-29 | Completed B5-B8 (prompt and terminology cleanup). All prompts now emit ready-to-copy commands with resolved paths. Ralph Loop usage sections added to all 3 stage prompts with matching run scripts. Stale registry paths and bare spec references fixed. "Commands" → "skills" terminology updated across ACM-ENV-SPEC, ACM-CONTEXT-ARTIFACT-SPEC, ACM-TAXONOMY, capability-registry brief, and experiment docs. |
| 2026-01-29 | Built acm-env plugin (all 8 phases) and capabilities registry. acm-env: plugin scaffold, 4 commands (status/setup/audit/reset), SessionStart hook, env-auditor skill, check-deps.sh with git freshness. Capabilities registry: migrated 20 capabilities from agent-harness (16 skills + 4 tools) + acm-env plugin = 21 total. capability.yaml as source of truth, generate-inventory.sh pipeline, REGISTRY-SPEC.md. Both repos pushed to GitHub (jessepike/acm, jessepike/capabilities-registry). Renamed capability-registry → capabilities-registry everywhere. Key decisions: plugins as 4th capability type, registry consumed by all stages, capability.yaml → inventory.json → INVENTORY.md data flow. Agent-harness ready to archive (B16). |
| 2026-01-30 | Fixed and installed acm-env plugin via local marketplace. Plugin had 3 issues: plugin.json had invalid fields (author as string, commands array), hooks.json used array instead of record, plugin was never registered through marketplace system. Created `acm-plugins` local marketplace at `~/.claude/plugins/acm-plugins/`, moved plugin source inside, registered and installed. Fixed check-deps.sh to query installed_plugins.json instead of filesystem paths. Fixed hardcoded paths in all 4 commands. Rewrote audit.md with explicit delegation to claude-md-management (CLAUDE.md quality scoring) and claude-code-setup (automation recommendations) — "You MUST delegate" pattern replacing vague "if available, delegate". Added capabilities registry validation to audit (cross-references INVENTORY.md against installed plugins). Assessed spec vs intent alignment — spec is sound, implementation had gaps in delegation and registry integration. Created KB articles: CUSTOM-PLUGIN-INSTALLATION.md, PLUGIN-DEVELOPMENT-PATTERNS.md. |
| 2026-01-30 | Ran `/acm-env:audit` end-to-end with delegation. Both dependency plugins (claude-md-management, claude-code-setup) successfully invoked — no fallbacks needed. Audit found 7 recommendations: fixed acm-env path in .claude/CLAUDE.md, trimmed global CLAUDE.md from 73→60 lines (B26), fixed 4 stale `ack-src/acm/` location paths in spec frontmatter, added frontmatter to DESIGN-HANDOFF.md, deleted stale inbox item (B27). Registry validation confirmed 7 untracked plugins (B23) and built-in skills model issue (B24). No automation recommendations for this spec/docs project. |
| 2026-01-30 | Massive capabilities registry and environment governance session. Registered 19 plugins total across 3 batches (registry grew 21→39). Added `install_id`/`install_level` to REGISTRY-SPEC.md schema. Defined plugin baseline v2.0.0 (6 required user-level, 15 available project-level, 3 to remove). Cleaned environment: removed superpowers/example-skills/serena, deleted 3 legacy commands (claude-mem, remember, save), disabled frontend-design/context7/playwright at user level. Created 2 new acm-env commands: `/acm-env:refresh` (upstream sync orchestrator) and `/acm-env:capabilities` (registry lookup). Fixed 4 registry scripts: check-freshness.sh (URL parsing + macOS timeout), sync.sh (skip active + declined), promote.sh (pipefail), and 6 upstream URLs. Implemented `declined.yaml` blocklist (15 entries: 3 MCP tools, 3 cruft plugins, 9 unused LSP plugins) integrated into sync pipeline. Researched all Anthropic marketplace plugins and 3 MCP tools. Plugin bumped to v1.1.0. |
| 2026-01-30 | Environment audit and registry cleanup session. Ran full `/acm-env:audit` with both delegations (claude-md-management, claude-code-setup). Found global CLAUDE.md at 60 lines (5 over limit), serena still installed (CLI uninstall failing), no MCP servers configured. Committed all uncommitted capabilities-registry work from prior session (27 files, 18 plugins, declined.yaml, spec fixes). Bumped REGISTRY-SPEC.md to v1.1.0 — fixed directory name typo, added declined section, updated Anthropic source to include plugins, removed stale brief reference. Updated README with declined.yaml and sources. Added B34 (MCP tools eval, P1), B35 (agents deep dive, P1/L), B36 (skills deep dive, P1/L) to backlog. Both repos pushed to GitHub. |
| 2026-01-30 | B34 MCP Server Registry — Discover complete, Design draft complete. Discover: drafted brief (brief-b34-mcp-servers.md), 2 internal review cycles, signed off at v1.0. Design: intake clarification (orchestration, interface, scan scope, triage filtering), drafted design-b34-mcp-servers.md v0.1. 7 work packages, extends refresh+setup commands, 3 new capability.yaml fields (install_vector, parent_plugin, transport), 4 plugin-bundled MCP extractions, baseline v3.0.0 schema. **Next: Design internal review (Ralph Loop), then external review, then Develop.** |
| 2026-01-30 | Link Triage Pipeline session. Reviewed PRD and design doc from link-triage repo. Analyzed B22 relationship. Split into two projects: pipeline (link-triage-pipeline) and future KB. Scaffolded link-triage-pipeline with ACM structure (intent, brief, CLAUDE.md). Ran Discover stage: internal review (3 cycles, 3 High resolved), external review (2 reviewers, clean pass, 3 Design questions). Brief at v0.4 status complete. Created ACM-REVIEW-SPEC.md (v1.0.0) — two-phase review mechanism spec (internal mandatory, external user-driven). Added `.claude/rules/review-process.md` — binding rule requiring Ralph Loop plugin for all internal reviews. Refactored all 6 stage review prompts to deduplicate mechanism against spec (-403/+207 lines). **Next: Design stage for link-triage-pipeline in new session.** |
| 2026-01-30 | Rules enforcement layer session. Reviewed Claude Code `.claude/rules/` capability and integrated into ACM. Created `.claude/rules/constraints.md` (security, governance, safety, session discipline, architectural boundaries). Created ACM-RULES-SPEC.md (v1.0.0) — two-layer governance model (rules=policy, CLAUDE.md=guidance), five content categories, file organization, lifecycle. Added rules stub for init script. Updated environment spec (governance model section), taxonomy (rules term + design decision), folder structure spec, global/project CLAUDE.md specs, init script. Added session discipline enforcement: rule requiring auto-commit and status.md updates (no asking), plus acm-env Stop hook (`stop-check.sh`) that blocks session end when uncommitted changes or stale status.md detected. Added hooks governance to baseline.yaml (declared hooks inventory), status dashboard (hooks section with drift detection), and audit command (section 5: hooks governance — scans for undeclared user-level hooks). Updated ACM-ENV-PLUGIN-SPEC.md with Stop hook, hooks governance section, and hooks in user-level baseline. |

| 2026-01-31 | B34 MCP Server Registry — Develop complete. All 7 WPs implemented. REGISTRY-SPEC.md v1.2.0 (3 MCP fields, 3 community sources, inbox). 4 legacy MCPs deleted+declined, 4 plugin-bundled MCPs created. baseline.yaml v2.1.0 (mcp_servers governance). refresh.md extended (community scan + triage). setup.md extended (MCP server checks). Inventory regenerated (39 caps). First triage: 500+ servers scanned, 0 high-relevance. Note: 4 plugin-bundled MCP upstream URLs unreachable (anthropics/claude-code-plugins likely private). |
| 2026-01-31 | Project separation — capabilities registry bootstrapped as independent project (BACKLOG.md, status.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md). Migrated B35→CR-1, B36→CR-2, B13→CR-3 to registry backlog. Archived processed B34 inbox docs. ACM backlog now ACM-scoped only. |
| 2026-01-31 | ACM MCP Server — Develop Phase 6 build complete. All phases A-E done. 13 tools implemented, 59 tests passing, companion skill created (skills/acm-workflow/), consumer wiring (.mcp.json), README. All 9 success criteria verified. |
| 2026-01-31 | Scope-aware status command + environment cleanup. Updated `/acm-env:status` with `--scope` flag (project default, user). Project scope shows user-level foundation + project specifics + capabilities (plugins, MCP servers). User scope shows cross-project config, plugins, MCP servers, hooks. Updated ACM-ENV-PLUGIN-SPEC.md with status command docs. Ran status check — found global CLAUDE.md at 61 lines (removed frontmatter → 52, PASS). Audited MCP server state: 0 standalone user-level, 13 plugin-bundled, 0 project-level for ACM. Identified 6 unwanted plugins with bundled MCP servers (asana, firebase, gitlab, laravel-boost, linear, slack) — added to baseline remove list + declined.yaml (21→27 declined). Clarified status vs inventory separation: status=validation (PASS/FAIL), capabilities=discovery (what's available). |
| 2026-01-31 | ACM MCP Server build complete — all phases. Phase D: companion skill (skills/acm-workflow/). Phase E: consumer wiring (.mcp.json), README, all 9 success criteria verified. Manual testing via MCP Inspector + Claude in Chrome — 4 tools tested across all categories, all passing. KB article: MCP-SERVER-MANUAL-TESTING.md. Architecture spec updated to v1.3.0 — new MCP Server Interface Layer section, MCP tool references on Orchestration/Capabilities/Knowledge/Validation primitives. Archived experiments/, cleaned up transient build docs. |
| 2026-01-31 | B14 External Review Skill — Design complete. Reviewed external review spec against ACM Architecture Spec and MCP Server Brief for alignment (all clean). Updated ACM-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC v1.2.0 (added skills/ and acm-server/ to physical layout). Added Stage column to BACKLOG.md for pipeline tracking. Archived ACM MCP server docs to _archive/. Moved spec from docs/inbox/ to docs/design.md, created discover-brief.md. Phase 1 internal review: 2 Ralph Loop cycles, 3C + 3H resolved (frontmatter, artifact paths, Phase 2 min cycles, ACM MCP server integration, moonshot→openai_compat collapse). Phase 2 external review (Gemini + GPT): 1 cycle, 1C + 3H resolved (provider ID mapping, artifact_content→artifact_path, extra_params pass-through, retry policy). Design v1.3.0 complete. Added B44 (frontmatter stage tracking), B45 (stage transition cleanup). |
| 2026-01-31 | B14 Develop Phases 1-4 complete. Phase 1 (Intake): resolved 6 design questions (path validation→project root+home, partial load, no cost metadata, project .mcp.json, venv, official mcp SDK). Phase 2 (Capability Assessment): manifest.md + capabilities.md. Phase 3 (Planning): plan.md + tasks.md (11 tasks, 6 phases). HARD GATE approved. Phase 4 (Review): Ralph Loop internal review — 3 cycles, 1C + 4H resolved (TDD co-location, venv task, server entry point, requirements.txt sequencing). Plan v1.1.0 ready for build. |
| 2026-02-01 | ACM-DEVELOP-SPEC.md v2.0.0 — major revision. Added Phase 7 (Documentation) + Phase 8 (Closeout). Two-tier testing model (automated + real-world). Progressive disclosure in tasks.md. Build-to-design verification in Phase 6. Commit cadence section. Universal + type-specific exit criteria. Removed registration from Develop (→ Deliver). ACM-STAGES-SPEC.md v1.2.0 — universal exit criteria + stage boundary handoff protocol. ACM-FOLDER-STRUCTURE-SPEC.md v1.2.0 — docs/acm/ convention for stage planning artifacts. Moved B14 artifacts to docs/acm/. Added B46-B51 to backlog. |
| 2026-01-31 | B14 Develop Phases 5-6 complete — full build. Phase A: scaffold, venv, config loading (9 tests), path validation (7 tests), provider base, MCP entry point + list_models. Phase B: OpenAI-compat provider (5 tests), Google provider (5 tests) — both with retry/backoff/extra_params. Phase C: review tool with parallel asyncio.gather, partial failures (5 tests). Phase D: config.yaml + SKILL.md. Phase E: integration tests (3 tests). Phase F: .mcp.json registration. Total: 34 tests passing, all 11 tasks done. |
| 2026-02-01 | B54: Elevated ACM-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC.md to master framework spec v2.0.0. Added spec map (reading guide), framework workflow diagram, stages overview, artifact flow model, interface map, complete spec index (19 specs with verified versions), revision history. Corrected plan version discrepancies (INTENT 1.0.1, REVIEW 1.2.0) and included 3 specs plan missed (BACKLOG, GLOBAL-CLAUDE-MD, PROJECT-CLAUDE-MD). |
| 2026-02-01 | B14 External Review — pricing + orchestration. Added per-model cost tracking to MCP server (calculate_cost in base.py, pricing pass-through in openai_compat + google providers, aggregated total_cost_usd + total_tokens in review response). Updated models.yaml with pricing rates. Rewrote SKILL.md with complete orchestration loop (8 substeps: call → synthesize → classify → capture → fix → update → check → loop), action matrix, synthesis prompt template, stop condition table, cost reporting in cycle logs and final summary. |

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D1 | Single `--scope` flag, not two commands | Same conceptual operation at different scopes; less surface area |
| D2 | Project scope is default | Most common use case — "what's affecting my project right now?" |
| D3 | Project view includes user-level as foundation | User-level applies to every project; showing both gives full picture |
| D4 | Add capabilities section (plugins + MCP) to dashboard | Status only checked config files, not actual capability state |
| D5 | Status vs inventory are separate concerns | Status=health check (validation against baseline), capabilities=inventory (enumeration/discovery). Don't merge them. |
| D6 | No user-level standalone MCP servers needed | Plugin-bundled MCPs activate with parent plugin — correct model. No cross-project MCP servers identified yet. |
| D7 | Unwanted marketplace plugins: disable + decline, don't delete | Marketplace auto-syncs external_plugins/; manual deletion gets reversed. Baseline remove list catches accidental enablement. |

## Notes for Next Session

### B14: External Review Skill — Build Complete (2026-01-31)

**Where we are:** Develop Phase 6 (Build) complete. All 11 tasks done, 34 tests passing. Ready for Develop internal review (Phase 7).

**What was built:**
- `skills/external-review/server/` — Python MCP server with FastMCP + stdio
- `config.py` — loads `~/.claude/models.yaml` + `config.yaml`, partial load, env var resolution (9 tests)
- `path_validation.py` — restricts artifact paths to project root + home (7 tests)
- `providers/base.py` — abstract BaseProvider + ReviewResponse dataclass
- `providers/openai_compat.py` — chat completion, retry w/ backoff, extra_params (5 tests)
- `providers/google.py` — generateContent, retry w/ backoff, extra_params (5 tests)
- `external_review_server.py` — 2 MCP tools: `list_models`, `review` (parallel via asyncio.gather)
- `test_review_tool.py` — review tool tests: all succeed, partial failure, all fail, not found, unknown model (5 tests)
- `test_integration.py` — server import, list_models, full review flow (3 tests)
- `skills/external-review/config.yaml` — stage→prompt mapping, defaults, cycle rules
- `skills/external-review/SKILL.md` — orchestration instructions for Claude Code
- `.mcp.json` — external-review server registered

**What was configured this session:**
- Created `~/.claude/models.yaml` — 3 models (gemini, gpt, kimi) with `api_key_env` references
- API keys stored as env vars in `~/.zshrc` (GOOGLE_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, MOONSHOT_API_KEY)
- Created `skills/external-review/README.md` — setup, API key config, MCP tools, testing docs

**What's next:**
- Restart Claude Code (MCP servers need new env vars)
- Live test: `list_models` should show 3 models with `available: true`
- Live test: `review` with a real artifact to confirm end-to-end
- Develop internal review (Phase 7) via Ralph Loop
- Then close out B14

**Repos:**
- ACM: `~/code/_shared/acm/`
- Capabilities Registry: `~/code/_shared/capabilities-registry/`
