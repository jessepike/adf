# Status

## Current State
- **Phase:** Build (framework quality improvements)
- **Focus:** Session discipline enforcement, spec compliance

## Next Steps
- [x] Build ADR skill — ADF-native Architecture Decision Records (first custom skill from marketplace research)
- [x] Build Project Health Auditor skill — code-level health metrics complementing adf-env:audit
- [x] Build Security Review skill — proactive review-pipeline-aware security checks
- [ ] B75: Standardize status enum values (in-progress vs in_progress) — blocks Work OS connector
- [ ] B76-B77: Spec cleanup (ACM remnant, status.md format drift)

## Session Log

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 2026-02-10 | **Capability gap analysis across full project ecosystem.** Explored all 10 active projects under ~/code (adf, capabilities-registry, knowledge-base, link-triage-pipeline, pike-acm, ai-risk-tools, dowell-therapy-portal, dowell-automation, papa-dogs-website, vet-books) plus 3 planned (krypton, work-management, memory). Cross-referenced project needs against 57-capability registry. Key gaps identified: (1) Prisma/DB migration safety (ai-risk-tools, 13+ tables), (2) RLS/auth policy auditing (50+ Supabase policies), (3) monorepo management (pnpm workspace), (4) content pipeline orchestration (pike-acm patterns not reusable). Also noted pike-acm's 3 agents untracked in registry. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Security Review skill v1.0.0 built + registered.** Created `skills/security-review/SKILL.md` (5 check categories, 22 checks, two dimensions: code + design, stage awareness, backlog filing) and `skills/security-review/references/security-checks.md` (22 checks with per-language Grep patterns for Python/TS/Go/Rust). Covers OWASP patterns (injection, XSS, SSRF, path traversal), cryptography (weak hashing, insecure randomness, hardcoded crypto material, TLS), unsafe operations (deserialization, file upload, TOCTOU, info leakage, prototype pollution), supply chain (lockfile integrity, typosquatting, post-install scripts, pinning), and design security posture (threat model, auth strategy, data classification, input validation). No duplication with project-health (secrets, CVEs) or security-guidance (8 runtime patterns). Registered in capabilities-registry (56→57 total). |
| 2026-02-09 | **Project Health Auditor skill v1.0.0 built + registered.** Created `skills/project-health/SKILL.md` (6 check categories, stage awareness, backlog filing) and `skills/project-health/references/check-catalog.md` (19 checks with per-language commands for Python/TS/Go/Rust). Registered in capabilities-registry (55→56 total). Verified MCP discoverability via `query_capabilities("project-health")`. |
| 2026-02-09 | **ADR skill v1.0.0 built + registered.** Created `skills/adr/SKILL.md` and `skills/adr/references/adr-template.md`. Four workflows: create, list, update-status, link. Registered in capabilities-registry (50→55 total, including 4 previously untracked agents). Verified MCP discoverability via `query_capabilities("adr")`. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Capability deep-dive planning.** Reviewed Tier 1 capabilities (Trail of Bits security skills, Project Health Auditor, ADR, Compliance Checker) against ADF needs. Decision: build custom ADF-native skills inspired by marketplace patterns rather than importing — tighter integration with ADF governance, stage flow, and review pipeline. Prioritized build order: (1) ADR skill, (2) Project Health Auditor skill, (3) Security Review skill. Approach: use marketplace as design brief, build purpose-built skills with Opus 4.6. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Marketplace research synthesis & KB capture.** Continued from prior session's 5-agent parallel research. Collected final outputs from all research agents (SkillsLLM: 1020 skills, SkillsMP/VoltAgent/ClaudeCodePlugins detailed). Captured comprehensive findings to KB (`2186aefe`). Produced prioritized shortlist: Tier 1 direct-fit (Trail of Bits 23+ security skills, Project Health Auditor, ADR skill, Compliance Checker), Tier 2 pattern-mining (Sprint plugin, planning-with-files, rulebook-ai, claude-flow), Tier 3 utility (cclsp LSP bridge, Skill_Seekers). Cross-referenced against registry (50 capabilities) — identified gaps in security review, ADR, compliance, code health metrics. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Agent skill ecosystem research.** Analyzed 7 sources across 3 tiers: SkillsMP (25K+ skills, SKILL.md standard), SkillsLLM (1020 skills), VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills (339+ curated from Anthropic/Trail of Bits/Sentry/Cloudflare/Microsoft), daymade/claude-code-skills, netresearch/claude-code-marketplace, ClaudeCodePlugins (313 plugins, 1336 skills, 29 categories). Mapped relevance to ADF across 6 dimensions (orchestration, governance, quality, docs, testing, review). Key findings: SKILL.md is the universal open standard; Sprint plugin closest to ADF orchestration; no ecosystem offers ADF's stage-gated orchestration, artifact spec enforcement, multi-phase review, or intent protection — these are ADF's unique differentiators. |
| 2026-02-07 | Removed redundant `skills/ecosystem-alignment/` from ADF repo (now in plugin). Registered ecosystem-alignment plugin + ecosystem-steward agent in capabilities-registry (48→50). Verified MCP discoverability via `query_capabilities`. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Ecosystem steward plugin.** (1) Created `ecosystem-alignment` plugin with `ecosystem-steward` agent, `/ecosystem:audit` command, and skill. (2) Ran first full audit — 17 findings across 6 checks (1 aligned, 4 drift, 1 gap). (3) Filed B75-B80 from audit findings. (4) Saved report to `docs/reports/ecosystem-alignment-2026-02-07.md`. Key findings: status enum mismatch (High), Krypton↔Work OS observation gap, terminology collisions. |
| 2026-02-07 | Ecosystem alignment skill: drafted `skills/ecosystem-alignment/SKILL.md` v0.1.0 — 6 checks (governing docs, interface contracts, dependency chain, terminology, intent alignment, open decisions). Audit-only, complements adf-env (per-project) and adf-review (per-artifact). Also drafted `docs/ecosystem-architecture.md` v0.1.0 — three-layer model (Process/Data/Intelligence), system map, integration points, dependency chain, current state. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Context harness analysis & KB integration.** (1) Mapped complete 9-layer ADF context harness (context, enforcement, memory, config, session state, ADF artifacts, plugins, agent memory, MCP) — captured to KB (`9631c0de`). (2) Analyzed auto-memory as ADF's unbuilt Memory primitive (B18-B19) — captured to KB (`1b556a4e`). (3) Added B74 (harness alignment audit) to BACKLOG v2.3.0. (4) Registered KB MCP server in .mcp.json — ADF agents can now query KB for cross-project knowledge. Changes from KB project session. |
| 2026-02-07 | Ecosystem synthesis continued: analyzed alignment of inbox docs against ADF-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC, identified gap (spec is inward-facing, missing ecosystem-level view). Proposed docs/ecosystem-architecture.md artifact to capture macro system map, layer model, integration points, and build dependencies. |
| 2026-02-07 | Ecosystem synthesis: reviewed inbox docs (Krypton brief v1, Work OS brief v5, memory layer research), mapped full project stack and inter-project dependencies (ADF → Work OS → Krypton). |
| 2026-02-07 | Registry audit: added kb-manager, link-triage, knowledge-base, doc-mgr to capabilities-registry (44→48). |
| 2026-02-04 | Added intent.md validation (Section 9) to adf-env audit — existence, frontmatter, sections, word count, placeholders, CLAUDE.md xref. Enhanced baseline.yaml. |
| 2026-02-04 | Quick wins: B69 (uninstall execute-plan), complete ACM→ADF rename in 13 files (specs, kb, prompts, server). |
| 2026-02-04 | Completed CLAUDE.md inheritance: adf-env:status size checks, baseline.yaml v2.2.0 with duplication validation and status.md limits. |
| 2026-02-04 | Global/Project CLAUDE.md alignment: Updated specs (v1.2.0), removed Agent Session Protocol from all stubs, added duplication detection to adf-env audit. |
| 2026-02-03 | adf-review skill unified. Stage transition cleanup. Archive rules. |
