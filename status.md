## Session Log

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 2026-01-27 | Discover stage complete. Two-phase review validated. YAGNI integrated. Ready for Design stage spec. |
| 2026-01-28 | Design and Develop stage specs complete. Supporting specs updated. |
| 2026-01-29 | Brainstormed and implemented acm-env plugin. Created ACM-ENV-PLUGIN-SPEC.md. Built full plugin scaffold with 4 commands, SessionStart hook, env-auditor skill, baseline.yaml, and dependency checker. Updated ACM-TAXONOMY.md (environment terms + 8 design decisions), ACM-CONTEXT-ARTIFACT-SPEC.md (replaced deferred acm-validate/acm-prune with acm-env reference), ACM-STAGES-SPEC.md (added acm-env as meta layer manager). |
| 2026-01-29 | Develop stage debrief session. Defined environment layer architecture (six primitives: orchestration, capabilities, knowledge, memory, maintenance, validation). Created ACM-ENVIRONMENT-SPEC.md, BACKLOG.md. Completed B1 (hardened start-develop prompt v2.0.0), B3 (phase boundary protocol in develop spec v1.2.0), B4 (review scoring across all 6 prompts — Critical/High/Low, min 2 max 10 cycles). Created capabilities-registry extraction brief for separate agent. Researched Claude Code 2.1.3 (commands folded into skills). Analyzed agent-harness sync system. Key decisions: registry as peer repo, memory as own repo, knowledge stays in ACM, workers are skills not separate repo, vendor is metadata not folder structure. |
| 2026-01-29 | Completed B5-B8 (prompt and terminology cleanup). All prompts now emit ready-to-copy commands with resolved paths. Ralph Loop usage sections added to all 3 stage prompts with matching run scripts. Stale registry paths and bare spec references fixed. "Commands" → "skills" terminology updated across ACM-ENV-SPEC, ACM-CONTEXT-ARTIFACT-SPEC, ACM-TAXONOMY, capability-registry brief, and experiment docs. |
| 2026-01-29 | Built acm-env plugin (all 8 phases) and capabilities registry. acm-env: plugin scaffold, 4 commands (status/setup/audit/reset), SessionStart hook, env-auditor skill, check-deps.sh with git freshness. Capabilities registry: migrated 20 capabilities from agent-harness (16 skills + 4 tools) + acm-env plugin = 21 total. capability.yaml as source of truth, generate-inventory.sh pipeline, REGISTRY-SPEC.md. Both repos pushed to GitHub (jessepike/acm, jessepike/capabilities-registry). Renamed capability-registry → capabilities-registry everywhere. Key decisions: plugins as 4th capability type, registry consumed by all stages, capability.yaml → inventory.json → INVENTORY.md data flow. Agent-harness ready to archive (B16). |
| 2026-01-30 | Fixed and installed acm-env plugin via local marketplace. Plugin had 3 issues: plugin.json had invalid fields (author as string, commands array), hooks.json used array instead of record, plugin was never registered through marketplace system. Created `acm-plugins` local marketplace at `~/.claude/plugins/acm-plugins/`, moved plugin source inside, registered and installed. Fixed check-deps.sh to query installed_plugins.json instead of filesystem paths. Fixed hardcoded paths in all 4 commands. Rewrote audit.md with explicit delegation to claude-md-management (CLAUDE.md quality scoring) and claude-code-setup (automation recommendations) — "You MUST delegate" pattern replacing vague "if available, delegate". Added capabilities registry validation to audit (cross-references INVENTORY.md against installed plugins). Assessed spec vs intent alignment — spec is sound, implementation had gaps in delegation and registry integration. Created KB articles: CUSTOM-PLUGIN-INSTALLATION.md, PLUGIN-DEVELOPMENT-PATTERNS.md. |
| 2026-01-30 | Ran `/acm-env:audit` end-to-end with delegation. Both dependency plugins (claude-md-management, claude-code-setup) successfully invoked — no fallbacks needed. Audit found 7 recommendations: fixed acm-env path in .claude/CLAUDE.md, trimmed global CLAUDE.md from 73→60 lines (B26), fixed 4 stale `ack-src/acm/` location paths in spec frontmatter, added frontmatter to DESIGN-HANDOFF.md, deleted stale inbox item (B27). Registry validation confirmed 7 untracked plugins (B23) and built-in skills model issue (B24). No automation recommendations for this spec/docs project. |
| 2026-01-30 | Massive capabilities registry and environment governance session. Registered 19 plugins total across 3 batches (registry grew 21→39). Added `install_id`/`install_level` to REGISTRY-SPEC.md schema. Defined plugin baseline v2.0.0 (6 required user-level, 15 available project-level, 3 to remove). Cleaned environment: removed superpowers/example-skills/serena, deleted 3 legacy commands (claude-mem, remember, save), disabled frontend-design/context7/playwright at user level. Created 2 new acm-env commands: `/acm-env:refresh` (upstream sync orchestrator) and `/acm-env:capabilities` (registry lookup). Fixed 4 registry scripts: check-freshness.sh (URL parsing + macOS timeout), sync.sh (skip active + declined), promote.sh (pipefail), and 6 upstream URLs. Implemented `declined.yaml` blocklist (15 entries: 3 MCP tools, 3 cruft plugins, 9 unused LSP plugins) integrated into sync pipeline. Researched all Anthropic marketplace plugins and 3 MCP tools. Plugin bumped to v1.1.0. |
| 2026-01-30 | Environment audit and registry cleanup session. Ran full `/acm-env:audit` with both delegations (claude-md-management, claude-code-setup). Found global CLAUDE.md at 60 lines (5 over limit), serena still installed (CLI uninstall failing), no MCP servers configured. Committed all uncommitted capabilities-registry work from prior session (27 files, 18 plugins, declined.yaml, spec fixes). Bumped REGISTRY-SPEC.md to v1.1.0 — fixed directory name typo, added declined section, updated Anthropic source to include plugins, removed stale brief reference. Updated README with declined.yaml and sources. Added B34 (MCP tools eval, P1), B35 (agents deep dive, P1/L), B36 (skills deep dive, P1/L) to backlog. Both repos pushed to GitHub. |
| 2026-01-30 | B34 MCP Server Registry — Discover complete, Design draft complete. Discover: drafted brief (brief-b34-mcp-servers.md), 2 internal review cycles, signed off at v1.0. Design: intake clarification (orchestration, interface, scan scope, triage filtering), drafted design-b34-mcp-servers.md v0.1. 7 work packages, extends refresh+setup commands, 3 new capability.yaml fields (install_vector, parent_plugin, transport), 4 plugin-bundled MCP extractions, baseline v3.0.0 schema. **Next: Design internal review (Ralph Loop), then external review, then Develop.** |
| 2026-01-30 | Link Triage Pipeline session. Reviewed PRD and design doc from link-triage repo. Analyzed B22 relationship. Split into two projects: pipeline (link-triage-pipeline) and future KB. Scaffolded link-triage-pipeline with ACM structure (intent, brief, CLAUDE.md). Ran Discover stage: internal review (3 cycles, 3 High resolved), external review (2 reviewers, clean pass, 3 Design questions). Brief at v0.4 status complete. Created ACM-REVIEW-SPEC.md (v1.0.0) — two-phase review mechanism spec (internal mandatory, external user-driven). Added `.claude/rules/review-process.md` — binding rule requiring Ralph Loop plugin for all internal reviews. Refactored all 6 stage review prompts to deduplicate mechanism against spec (-403/+207 lines). **Next: Design stage for link-triage-pipeline in new session.** |
| 2026-01-30 | Rules enforcement layer session. Reviewed Claude Code `.claude/rules/` capability and integrated into ACM. Created `.claude/rules/constraints.md` (security, governance, safety, session discipline, architectural boundaries). Created ACM-RULES-SPEC.md (v1.0.0) — two-layer governance model (rules=policy, CLAUDE.md=guidance), five content categories, file organization, lifecycle. Added rules stub for init script. Updated environment spec (governance model section), taxonomy (rules term + design decision), folder structure spec, global/project CLAUDE.md specs, init script. Added session discipline enforcement: rule requiring auto-commit and status.md updates (no asking), plus acm-env Stop hook (`stop-check.sh`) that blocks session end when uncommitted changes or stale status.md detected. Added hooks governance to baseline.yaml (declared hooks inventory), status dashboard (hooks section with drift detection), and audit command (section 5: hooks governance — scans for undeclared user-level hooks). Updated ACM-ENV-PLUGIN-SPEC.md with Stop hook, hooks governance section, and hooks in user-level baseline. |

| 2026-01-31 | B34 MCP Server Registry — Develop complete. All 7 WPs implemented. REGISTRY-SPEC.md v1.2.0 (3 MCP fields, 3 community sources, inbox). 4 legacy MCPs deleted+declined, 4 plugin-bundled MCPs created. baseline.yaml v2.1.0 (mcp_servers governance). refresh.md extended (community scan + triage). setup.md extended (MCP server checks). Inventory regenerated (39 caps). First triage: 500+ servers scanned, 0 high-relevance. Note: 4 plugin-bundled MCP upstream URLs unreachable (anthropics/claude-code-plugins likely private). |
| 2026-01-31 | Project separation — capabilities registry bootstrapped as independent project (BACKLOG.md, status.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md). Migrated B35→CR-1, B36→CR-2, B13→CR-3 to registry backlog. Archived processed B34 inbox docs. ACM backlog now ACM-scoped only. |
| 2026-01-31 | Scope-aware status command + environment cleanup. Updated `/acm-env:status` with `--scope` flag (project default, user). Project scope shows user-level foundation + project specifics + capabilities (plugins, MCP servers). User scope shows cross-project config, plugins, MCP servers, hooks. Updated ACM-ENV-PLUGIN-SPEC.md with status command docs. Ran status check — found global CLAUDE.md at 61 lines (removed frontmatter → 52, PASS). Audited MCP server state: 0 standalone user-level, 13 plugin-bundled, 0 project-level for ACM. Identified 6 unwanted plugins with bundled MCP servers (asana, firebase, gitlab, laravel-boost, linear, slack) — added to baseline remove list + declined.yaml (21→27 declined). Clarified status vs inventory separation: status=validation (PASS/FAIL), capabilities=discovery (what's available). |

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D1 | Single `--scope` flag, not two commands | Same conceptual operation at different scopes; less surface area |
| D2 | Project scope is default | Most common use case — "what's affecting my project right now?" |
| D3 | Project view includes user-level as foundation | User-level applies to every project; showing both gives full picture |
| D4 | Add capabilities section (plugins + MCP) to dashboard | Status only checked config files, not actual capability state |
| D5 | Status vs inventory are separate concerns | Status=health check (validation against baseline), capabilities=inventory (enumeration/discovery). Don't merge them. |
| D6 | No user-level standalone MCP servers needed | Plugin-bundled MCPs activate with parent plugin — correct model. No cross-project MCP servers identified yet. |
| D7 | Unwanted marketplace plugins: disable + decline, don't delete | Marketplace auto-syncs external_plugins/; manual deletion gets reversed. Baseline remove list catches accidental enablement. |

## Notes for Next Session

Scope-aware status command complete. Environment cleanup done — 6 unwanted plugins added to baseline remove + declined.yaml. Global CLAUDE.md trimmed to 52 lines (frontmatter removed). Capabilities registry at 39 capabilities, 27 declined entries.

**Key files changed this session:**
- `acm-env/commands/status.md` — scope flag, capabilities sections, MCP reporting
- `ACM-ENV-PLUGIN-SPEC.md` — status command documentation
- `acm-env/skills/env-auditor/references/baseline.yaml` — 6 new remove entries
- `capabilities-registry/declined.yaml` — 6 new declined entries
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — frontmatter removed (61→52 lines)

**Next priorities:**
- B34: MCP Server Registry — Develop stage (moved to Done, was blocking)
- B15: Deliver stage spec
- B18-B19: Memory layer spec and scaffold
- Link Triage Pipeline: Design stage (new session, run from `~/code/_shared/link-triage-pipeline/`)

**Project separation:** Capabilities registry now has its own BACKLOG.md, status.md, and .claude/CLAUDE.md. B35, B36, B13 migrated to capabilities-registry as CR-1, CR-2, CR-3.

**Repos:**
- ACM: https://github.com/jessepike/acm.git → `~/code/_shared/acm/`
- Capabilities Registry: https://github.com/jessepike/capabilities-registry.git → `~/code/_shared/capabilities-registry/`
- acm-env plugin: `~/.claude/plugins/acm-plugins/plugins/acm-env/`
