# Status

## Current State
- **Phase:** Build (framework quality improvements)
- **Focus:** Session discipline enforcement, spec compliance

## Next Steps
- [ ] B18-B19: Memory layer spec and scaffold (auto-memory integration analysis available — KB `1b556a4e`)
- [ ] B74: Context harness alignment audit
- [ ] Status.md pruning automation in adf-env

## Session Log

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 2026-02-07 | Ecosystem alignment skill: drafted `skills/ecosystem-alignment/SKILL.md` v0.1.0 — 6 checks (governing docs, interface contracts, dependency chain, terminology, intent alignment, open decisions). Audit-only, complements adf-env (per-project) and adf-review (per-artifact). Also drafted `docs/ecosystem-architecture.md` v0.1.0 — three-layer model (Process/Data/Intelligence), system map, integration points, dependency chain, current state. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Context harness analysis & KB integration.** (1) Mapped complete 9-layer ADF context harness (context, enforcement, memory, config, session state, ADF artifacts, plugins, agent memory, MCP) — captured to KB (`9631c0de`). (2) Analyzed auto-memory as ADF's unbuilt Memory primitive (B18-B19) — captured to KB (`1b556a4e`). (3) Added B74 (harness alignment audit) to BACKLOG v2.3.0. (4) Registered KB MCP server in .mcp.json — ADF agents can now query KB for cross-project knowledge. Changes from KB project session. |
| 2026-02-07 | Ecosystem synthesis continued: analyzed alignment of inbox docs against ADF-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC, identified gap (spec is inward-facing, missing ecosystem-level view). Proposed docs/ecosystem-architecture.md artifact to capture macro system map, layer model, integration points, and build dependencies. |
| 2026-02-07 | Ecosystem synthesis: reviewed inbox docs (Krypton brief v1, Work OS brief v5, memory layer research), mapped full project stack and inter-project dependencies (ADF → Work OS → Krypton). |
| 2026-02-07 | Registry audit: added kb-manager, link-triage, knowledge-base, doc-mgr to capabilities-registry (44→48). |
| 2026-02-04 | Added intent.md validation (Section 9) to adf-env audit — existence, frontmatter, sections, word count, placeholders, CLAUDE.md xref. Enhanced baseline.yaml. |
| 2026-02-04 | Quick wins: B69 (uninstall execute-plan), complete ACM→ADF rename in 13 files (specs, kb, prompts, server). |
| 2026-02-04 | Completed CLAUDE.md inheritance: adf-env:status size checks, baseline.yaml v2.2.0 with duplication validation and status.md limits. |
| 2026-02-04 | Global/Project CLAUDE.md alignment: Updated specs (v1.2.0), removed Agent Session Protocol from all stubs, added duplication detection to adf-env audit. |
| 2026-02-03 | adf-review skill unified. Stage transition cleanup. Archive rules. |
