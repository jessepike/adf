# Start Develop Stage

## Purpose

Transition from Design to Develop. Validates prerequisites, updates state, loads context, and conducts intake validation with human confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Prompt

You are transitioning this project from Design to Develop stage.

## Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

Read and verify:
- status.md — Confirm stage is Design and phase is complete
- design.md — Confirm status is complete, no open P1 issues
- Any supporting design docs (architecture.md, etc.) if referenced

**CRITICAL — Missing Resources:**
If any expected file is missing (e.g., ACM-DEVELOP-SPEC.md referenced but not found):
- STOP immediately
- Report exactly what is missing
- Ask the user to provide it
- Do NOT assume you lack access — the user may have forgotten to copy it
- Do NOT skip and move on

If prerequisites are NOT met:
- STOP
- Report what's missing or incomplete
- Do not proceed until Design exit criteria are satisfied

If prerequisites ARE met, continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Update State

Update status.md:
- stage: develop
- phase: intake
- last_action: "Transitioned from Design"
- next_steps: "Conducting intake validation"

## Step 3: Load Context

Read and internalize:
- design.md — Your primary input (the technical specification)
- Any supporting design docs (architecture.md, data-model.md, etc.)
- discover-brief.md — Reference for success criteria

Note the project classification (type + modifiers) from Brief.

## Step 4: Intake Validation

**HARD GATE: Do NOT proceed to Capability Assessment or Planning until human confirms understanding.**

Your goal: Ensure 100% understanding of the design before any implementation work.

### 4a. Summarize Understanding

Provide a clear summary:
- What we're building (2-3 sentences)
- Key technical choices from design
- Success criteria from Brief

### 4b. Surface Open Items

Check design.md for:
- "Notes for Develop" or "Questions for Develop" sections
- Open questions or deferred items
- Any P2/P3 issues that need decisions

**Walk through EACH open item individually.** Do NOT batch defaults together.

For each open item:
1. State the item clearly
2. Ask user to decide, OR propose a default and ask for confirmation
3. Wait for response before moving to next item

Example (WRONG): "I found 4 open items. Want me to use defaults for all?"
Example (RIGHT): "Open item 1: Light theme tokens are unspecified. Should I derive from dark theme, or do you have specific colors?"

### 4c. Ask Clarifying Questions

Use AskUserQuestion or direct questions for:
- Technical choices — "The design specifies X. Is this confirmed?"
- Ambiguities — "This section is unclear. What did you intend?"
- Dependencies — "This requires Y. Is it available?"
- Priorities — "If we hit constraints, what's negotiable?"

Ask in batches of 2-4 questions. Continue until all ambiguities resolved.

### 4d. Self-Validation Checkpoint

**Before asking to proceed, perform this self-check:**

- Have I resolved ALL open items from design.md?
- Are there ANY remaining ambiguities I haven't asked about?
- Is there ANYTHING else I need to know before building?

If the answer to any is "yes" — go back and ask. Do NOT ask to proceed until you've exhausted your questions.

### 4e. Confirm Understanding

When you believe you have full clarity, state:

"I have full understanding of the design:
- [1-2 sentence summary]
- [Key decisions resolved]
- [Open items addressed]

Ready to proceed to Capability Assessment. Confirm?"

**WAIT for human confirmation before proceeding.**

Do NOT:
- Proceed to capability assessment without explicit confirmation
- Start writing plan.md or tasks.md
- Assume silence means approval

## Step 5: Proceed to Planning Phases (2-3)

Only after human confirms understanding:

1. Update status.md phase to: capability-assessment
2. Draft manifest.md (dependencies)
3. Draft capabilities.md (skills/tools/agents) — **query the capability registry** at `~/code/_shared/capabilities-registry/INVENTORY.md` to identify available capabilities that match project needs. Document gaps where needed capabilities are not in the registry.
4. Present capability assessment for approval
5. Then proceed to Planning phase (plan.md + tasks.md)

**After Phase 3 (Planning), STOP. This is a HARD GATE.**

Present all planning artifacts to the human:
- manifest.md
- capabilities.md
- plan.md
- tasks.md

**⛔ DO NOT proceed to execution phases. DO NOT start environment setup. DO NOT start building.**

Wait for explicit human approval: "Approved" or equivalent.

If the human has feedback, iterate on planning artifacts. Do not move forward until they approve.

## Step 6: Proceed to Execution Phases (4-6)

**PREREQUISITE: Human has explicitly approved all planning artifacts from Step 5.**

If you do not have explicit human approval, STOP and ask for it.

**Phase boundary protocol:** Before starting each execution phase:
1. Update status.md with phase completion
2. Run `/clear` to reset context
3. Re-read: CLAUDE.md → status.md → tasks.md → plan.md
4. Confirm: "Phase N complete. Starting Phase N+1. Here's what I see: [summary]"

Execution phases:
1. Review Loop — Run internal review (Ralph Loop) on plan, then external review
2. Environment Setup — Install dependencies, configure capabilities
3. Build — Implement per tasks.md with TDD

---

## Phase Sequence (For Reference)

**PLANNING PHASES (1-3)** — Produce artifacts, stop for human review:
1. **Intake & Validation** ← YOU ARE HERE (requires human confirmation to exit)
2. Capability Assessment (produces manifest.md + capabilities.md)
3. Planning (produces plan.md + tasks.md)

**⛔ HARD GATE: After Phase 3, STOP. Present all planning artifacts for human review.**
**DO NOT proceed to execution until human explicitly approves.**
**This gate exists because agents historically skip it. DO NOT skip it.**

**EXECUTION PHASES (4-6)** — Require explicit human approval of planning artifacts:
4. Review Loop (internal + external review of plan)
5. Environment Setup
6. Build

Do NOT skip phases. Each phase has an exit gate.
Planning and execution are separate workflows — complete all planning first.
**Between each phase:** Run phase boundary protocol (update status → /clear → re-read → confirm).

## Notes

- Intent.md is already loaded via CLAUDE.md
- Design is CONSUMED in Develop (fully loaded and processed)
- Brief is REFERENCED (for success criteria verification)
- Updates to design docs during Develop: document and move on, no re-review needed
- If resources are missing, STOP and ask — don't skip
